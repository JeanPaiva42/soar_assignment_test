### **Risk Information**:

- **Low Risk**: Standard functionality, expected behavior, or non-critical flow (e.g., user notifications, standard error messages).
- **Medium Risk**: Includes potential user frustration or non-standard behavior, which may affect user experience but does not cause critical system failure (e.g., incorrect OTP).
- **High Risk**: Critical functionality or security-related issues, which could lead to system compromise, data breach, or significant business impact (e.g., logout from all devices, rejected documents).
